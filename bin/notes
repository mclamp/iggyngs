# Other things

   -  Need a wrapper script for processIlluminaRun.py that looks for the seqprep.txt (or whatever it is) file for re-running.
   -  processIlluminaRun.py needs to take an output dir directly for multiple processing runs
   -  processIlluminaRun.py needs to take a rundir directly for non-standard runs
